### Who is _Rick O'Shea_?

Rick O’Shea is an average teenage boy. One day a letter arrives. His great uncle Mick has passed away and left him a grand estate in a small town in Ireland. Hopping on a plane, he sets out to investigate. When he arrives in town, he finds the townsfolk to be warm and welcoming. However, when he mentions his family estate, he finds that for some reason they become distant and cold… _How odd_, he thinks, but nevertheless he soldiers on.


On one cold and stormy night, Rick is settling in when he can’t escape a strange sensation, like something has gone very, very wrong.


On his first night, as the clock struck midnight, he wakes with a start. _Where am I?_ he said, touching the dried blood on his forehead. Around him is an unfamiliar bedroom. Grabbing the bizarre-looking plasma gun on the nightstand, he begins to investigate, finding a disturbing house full of creatures. He realizes one thing. He needs to get out now.

### Gameplay
_Rick O'Shea_ is a top down survival shooter. You control Rick as he works his way through this disturbing house looking for the way out. You must find the final exit in order to complete the game. Throughout the house are terrifying creatures who will attack on first glance. Luckily Rick carries his new trusty plasma gun which fires deadly plasma bolts capable of destroying a creature in one hit. However, there's one catch. These bolts ricochet off walls. While this enables creative angles for defending yourself, it can also be a danger to Rick if you're not careful.
