### Who is _Rick O'Shea_?

Rick O'Shea is a teenage Irishman. On one cold and stormy night, Rick felt a strange sensation, like something had gone very, very wrong. In the morning, he woke with a start. _Where am I?_ he said, touching the dried blood on his forehead. Around him is an unfamiliar bedroom. Grabbing the bizarre-looking plasma gun on the nightstand, he opens the door to investigate, finding a disturbing house full of creatures. He realizes one thing. He needs to get out now.
